noThis is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project.

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes.
